# X-Wing Death Star Assault

A 3D space shooter game where players pilot an X-Wing fighter to assault the Death Star.

## Game Concept

Players control an X-Wing fighter navigating through space, avoiding obstacles and enemy fire while targeting the Death Star's vulnerable points. The gameplay is inspired by the iconic trench run sequence from Star Wars.

## Technologies

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- HTML5 and JavaScript
- Potentially using a physics engine for realistic movement

## Installation & Running

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project folder
3. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended)

No build process is needed since we're using CDN-hosted Three.js.

## Controls

The X-Wing can be fully controlled with the following keys:

- W or Up Arrow: Move forward
- S or Down Arrow: Move backward
- Left/Right Arrows: Yaw (turn left/right)
- A/D: Roll (rotate left/right)
- Q/E: Pitch (rotate up/down)
- Spacebar: Fire lasers
